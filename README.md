# Blog Backups

This repository contains backups of my tech blog content. The blog covers a wide range of topics related to technology, programming, and software development.

## Contents

- **Posts**: Markdown files for all published blog posts, organized by year and month.
- **Images**: Images and other media assets used in the blog posts.
- **Drafts**: Unpublished draft posts that are still work-in-progress.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a backup and version control system for my blog content. By storing the content on GitHub, I can:

- Keep track of changes to posts over time using Git's powerful version control features.
- Easily revert to previous versions of posts if needed.
- Collaborate with others on blog posts or invite contributions.
- Automatically sync content between my local development environment and the live blog.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily intended for my personal use, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community. If you find any errors, have ideas for improving existing posts, or would like to suggest new topics, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
